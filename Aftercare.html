        </div>
        <div class="instruction">
            <b>Leave the Bandage On:</b>Your tattoo artist will cover your fresh tattoo with a sterile bandage or wrap. Leave this on for at least 2-4 hours, or as advised by your artist. This helps protect your tattoo from bacteria and contaminants.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Gentle Washing:</b> After removing the bandage, gently wash the tattooed area with lukewarm water and mild, fragrance-free soap. Use your clean hands to wash, avoiding any scrubbing or abrasive materials.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Pat Dry:</b> Gently pat the tattooed area dry with a clean paper towel or soft, lint-free cloth. Do not rub or use a regular towel, as it may irritate the tattoo.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Apply a Thin Layer of Healing Ointment:</b>Apply a tattoo-specific healing ointment recommended by your tattoo artist. Use a very thin layer to keep the tattoo moisturized and aid in the healing process.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Avoid Sun Exposure:</b> Keep your new tattoo out of direct sunlight and tanning beds. Sun exposure can fade the colors and damage the healing skin. If you need to be in the sun, use a high SPF sunscreen.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>No Swimming or Soaking:</b> Avoid swimming in pools, hot tubs, or soaking in baths until your tattoo is fully healed. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to infection or fading.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Avoid Tight Clothing:</b> Wear loose-fitting clothing over the tattooed area to prevent friction and irritation. Tight clothing can rub against the tattoo and slow down the healing process.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Don't Pick or Scratch:</b> Do not pick, scratch, or peel the scabs that may form during the healing process. Let them come off naturally to avoid damaging the tattoo.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Stay Hydrated:</b> Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated, which aids in the healing process and prevents excessive dryness.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Be Patient:</b> Tattoo healing time varies but usually takes about 2-4 weeks. Be patient and allow your tattoo to heal at its own pace.

            Permanent Makeup Aftercare Guidelines:

            We highly recommend that all clients who have undergone Permanent Makeup procedures schedule a second session. The purpose of this second session is to address any natural fading that may occur during the healing process. Please note that the final results of your Permanent Makeup cannot be accurately assessed until the follow-up appointment has been completed. The retention of pigment depends on various factors, including skin type, age, adherence to aftercare, sun exposure, and individual variables. Annual touch-up sessions are also advisable to prevent natural fading.
            <br>
            <br>
            Immediate Aftercare (First Few Hours):
            <br>
            <br>
            Gently pat dry any areas with bleeding or oozing using a clean cotton pad. This step is essential to prevent the formation of large scabs during the initial healing period.
            First Night Care:
            <br>
            <br>
            On the first night after your procedure, cleanse the treated area using a cotton pad, warm water, and a mild, fragrance-free soap. After cleansing, apply the recommended ointment as directed.
            <br>
            <br>
            Daily Care for the First 3 Days:
            <br>
            <br>
            Apply a thin layer of Aquaphor ointment to the treated area twice a day for the first three days. Ensure that the application is gentle and not excessive.
            Additional Considerations:
            <br>
            <br>
            Refrain from swimming, using saunas/steam rooms, or engaging in strenuous physical activities during the initial healing phase.
            After 1-2 weeks, you may notice scabs starting to peel. It is crucial not to pick, scratch, or scrub the treated area, as this can disrupt the healing process. It may also become itchy, but avoid any actions that may irritate the skin.
            <br>
            <br>
            Longer-Term Aftercare:
            <br>
            Avoid applying makeup over the treated area for the next 3-4 weeks to allow for proper healing and pigment retention.
            Your commitment to these aftercare instructions plays a vital role in the successful healing and longevity of your Permanent Makeup. If you have any questions or concerns during the healing process, please do not hesitate to reach out to us for guidance and support. Your satisfaction with the final results of your Permanent Makeup is our top priority.
