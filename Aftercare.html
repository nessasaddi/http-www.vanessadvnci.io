        <div class="item">
            <p>
                <b>Leave the Bandage On:</b><br> Your tattoo artist will cover your fresh tattoo with a sterile bandage or wrap. Leave this on for at least 2-4 hours, or as advised by your artist. This helps protect your tattoo from bacteria and contaminants.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Gentle Washing:</b><br> After removing the bandage, gently wash the tattooed area with lukewarm water and mild, fragrance-free soap. Use your clean hands to wash, avoiding any scrubbing or abrasive materials.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Pat Dry:</b><br> Gently pat the tattooed area dry with a clean paper towel or soft, lint-free cloth. Do not rub or use a regular towel, as it may irritate the tattoo.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Apply a Thin Layer of Healing Ointment:</b><br> Apply a tattoo-specific healing ointment recommended by your tattoo artist. Use a very thin layer to keep the tattoo moisturized and aid in the healing process.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Avoid Sun Exposure:</b><br> Keep your new tattoo out of direct sunlight and tanning beds. Sun exposure can fade the colors and damage the healing skin. If you need to be in the sun, use a high SPF sunscreen.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>No Swimming or Soaking:</b><br> Avoid swimming in pools, hot tubs, or soaking in baths until your tattoo is fully healed. Prolonged exposure to water can lead to infection or fading.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Avoid Tight Clothing:</b><br> Wear loose-fitting clothing over the tattooed area to prevent friction and irritation. Tight clothing can rub against the tattoo and slow down the healing process.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Don't Pick or Scratch:</b><br> Do not pick, scratch, or peel the scabs that may form during the healing process. Let them come off naturally to avoid damaging the tattoo.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Stay Hydrated:</b><br> Drink plenty of water to keep your skin hydrated, which aids in the healing process and prevents excessive dryness.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Be Patient:</b><br> Tattoo healing time varies but usually takes about 2-4 weeks. Be patient and allow your tattoo to heal at its own pace.
            </p>

            <p><b>We highly recommend</b> scheduling a second session for Permanent Makeup to address natural fading during healing.
                Final results can't be accurately assessed until this follow-up. Pigment retention depends on skin type, age,
                aftercare, sun exposure, and individual factors. Annual touch-ups prevent natural fading. <br><br>

            <p>
                <b>Immediate Aftercare:</b><br>
                Gently pat dry bleeding or oozing areas with a clean cotton pad to prevent large scabs.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>First Night After Procedure:</b><br>
                Cleanse the treated area with warm water, mild soap, and a cotton pad. Apply recommended ointment after cleansing.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>First 3 Days Daily Care:</b><br>
                Apply a thin layer of Aquaphor ointment twice daily for three days, avoiding excessive application.<br><br>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <b>Additional Considerations:</b><br>
                Avoid swimming, saunas, or strenuous activities during initial healing. After 1-2 weeks, scabs may peel; avoid picking, scratching, or scrubbing to prevent healing disruption. Avoid makeup over the treated area for 3-4 weeks for proper healing and pigment retention.<br><br>
            </p>
